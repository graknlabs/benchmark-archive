  # highly connected square - edges, diagonals, ternary relation and quaternary relations
  # It may be interesting to keep the ternary relations as unspecific types to see if we
  # can prune search space using histograms of connectivity (eg. the only relations with more than 2
  # role players are actually interactions!). Meanwhile many relations have two RPs so we don't gain any information
