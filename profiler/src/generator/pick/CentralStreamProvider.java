/**
 *
 * This is a highly flexible StreamProvider. The idea of a _central_ stream is that one or several concepts
 * will be the center of many relationships added (ie. imagine this as a _repeated concept provider_)
 *
 * It can be specified with two PDFs:
 * The one used to construct specifies how many _central_ concepts will be provided. For example,
 * when adding multiple relationships, if the centralConceptsPdf specifies `1`, all relationships
 * will connect to that same Concept.
 *
 * The second PDF specifies how many of these central items to withdraw in a stream this iteration.
 * The specific values are chosen from the list of central concepts as a circular buffer from the last
 * index that hasn't been used.
