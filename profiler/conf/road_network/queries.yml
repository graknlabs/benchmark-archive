queries:
  # expect to see this scale linearly with scale
  - "match $x isa road; get;"
  # expect to see scale in out degree of name (increasing increments) and number of names (fixed increments)
  - "match $x has name $n; get;"
  # expect to see scale in role player (upper bounded) * number of relationships (fixed increments)
  - "match $r (endpoint: $endpoint); get $endpoint;"


  # NOTE: all pure insert queries must provide variables for each inserted concept or they won't be deleted
  - "insert $x isa road;"
  - "insert $x isa name; $x \"helloworld\";" # insert an attr value that doesn't exist
  - "insert $r1 isa road; $r2 isa road; $r3 isa road; $inter (endpoint: $r1, endpoint: $r2, endpoint: $r3) isa interaction;"
