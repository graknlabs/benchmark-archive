# test comment, some graphs have headers or descriptions that need to be ignored
# metrics for this graph:
# degree distribution: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
# compressed degree distribution [0th, 20th, 50th, 70th, 100th]: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]
# degree assortativity = -0.38888888888888995
# transitivity: 0.25
# NOTE this is not the same graph as is used in the unit tests! Similar but not quite
